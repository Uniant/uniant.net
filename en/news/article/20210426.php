                    <span>Today, Trownsoft has become Uniant.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Revision of Designations</h3>
                    <span>Trownsoft has been using many names that could be misconstrued as corporate, and Uniant will eliminate all such names and operate as a genuine "group".</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Renewal of the Personnel System</h3>
                    <span>In addition to the existing recruitment format, Uniant will implement "invitation-only recruitment", in which we invite non-members from our association. We will continue to promote development more actively.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">A more Transparent Community</h3>
                    <span>We aim to make the community more transparent by allowing everyone to join Uniant's Discord general server.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Simplified Procedures</h3>
                    <span>Although it's an internal issue, there have been several cases at Trownsoft where people have been hindered by cumbersome procedures that prevented them from doing what they wanted to do. Uniant will eliminate all cumbersome procedures and make it easier for people to be more active by focusing on efficiency.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Conducting training sessions for beginning students</h3>
                    <span>At Uniant, we train people to participate in our activities even if they have no skills. This will transform the community into a safe place for people with no experience to join.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Origin of Name "Uniant"</h3>
                    <span>Uniant is a word coined from the combination of "Unite" and "Radiant". It expresses our hope that by working together as one, we can create a wonderful community that shines.</span>
                    <h3 class="newsbig">Our Slogan: "New Future, New Technology."</h3>
                    <span>The new corona pandemic is driving digitalization in this age. Uniant will open up a new era with its technology and become a leader in the digital society.</span>
